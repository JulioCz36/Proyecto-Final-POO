# 🏎️ Run or Die – Final Project for OOP

2D racing video game developed as the final project for an Object-Oriented Programming course.
It was chosen to apply all the concepts learned during the semester.

## 🎯 Objective

Compete between two players on 2 different circuits (there are 4 in the code).
The player with the best total average time over the 2 races wins.
If they achieve a good time, they can enter the Top 10 ranking, which is saved to a file.

## 🎮 Mecánicas del juego

- **2 players**:
  - Player 1: Arrow keys (`↑ ↓ ← →`)
  - Player 2: Keys `W A S D`
- **Collisions** between cars
- **Off-track zones**:  reduce speed
- **Checkpoints** to register laps
- **Lap timer** for each race

## ⚙️ Course Content Applied

- ✅ Pointers
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming
- ✅ Operator overloading
- ✅ Binary file handling
- ✅ Templates
- ✅ STL (vector, sort, etc.)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Download the "Installer" folder.
2. Inside, you’ll find all the necessary files and an executable file (`RunOrDie.exe`).
3. Run the `.exe` directly to play.  
  No installation or additional configuration required.

> ⚠️Make sure not to move or delete the files that come with the executable, as the game depends on them to function properly.
